Okay, so I need to figure out how to execute a script from a file in Python. I've heard that the `exec()` function is used for this, but I'm not entirely sure how it works. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I know that when you run a script, you can either use the command line or write it to a file and execute it from there. If I want to do both, maybe using `exec()` on the file is an option because it gives control over where the script runs.

So, let's start with writing the script into a file. In Python, I can open a new file using `with open()`, specify the mode as 'r' so it reads from the file, and then write each line of code to that file. Once I have the file, I can read it into a variable and execute it.

Wait, but how do I make sure that this script runs in the correct environment? Oh right, using `with open()` handles that for me because it's managed by Python automatically when you open and close files.

Okay, so here's an example. Suppose I have a file called 'my_script.py' with some code:

```python
print("Hello from my script!")
```

I can write this to a .py file using `with open('my_script.py', 'r') as f: f.write(your_code_here)`. Then, after that, I can use `exec` on that file. So inside the script, it would look like:

```python
def my_script():
    print("Hello from my script!")
```

Wait, but when I open a .py file, is the code in Python or JavaScript? Oh right, because by default, `with open('file') as f: f.read()` reads Python 2 code into a string. So if I want to run it in Python 3, I need to make sure the script is Python 3 compatible.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use `readlines()` or write the script as JavaScript. Hmm, that might be more complicated. Maybe using the `script` library could help, but I'm not sure about that yet.

Another approach: after writing the script into a .py file, how do I execute it? So the shell command would be `python3 my_script.py`, right? Or if I want to run it from the current directory, maybe using the terminal. But wait, if the script is in a different location, I might need to use `system()`, but that's usually for Unix-like systems.

Wait, but how do I make sure that the script runs as Python 3 and not something else? Oh, right, because when you open a .py file, it reads Python 2 code. So if my script is in a directory where it's executed with `python3`, then perhaps writing the script in Python 3 would work.

Alternatively, maybe using an interactive shell, like `bash` or `curl -o ...`. But that might not be as flexible for executing files from anywhere.

So putting it all together: I open the file, write my code, then use `exec()` to run it. That should execute the script correctly, assuming it's a valid Python 3 script and is in the right place.

Wait, but what if the
